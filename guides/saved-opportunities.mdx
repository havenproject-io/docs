# Overview

The [**Saved**](https://www.havenproject.io/saved-opportunities) page is your team’s centralized space for managing and organizing saved opportunities. Think of it as a CRM tailored to your contracting workflow, complete with Kanban-style functionality and team collaboration features.

# Key Features

* **Kanban-Style Board**

  * Opportunities are organized into the following columns:

    * **Backlog**: Opportunities yet to be prioritized.

    * **Diligence**: Opportunities under review or being researched.

    * **Bidding**: Opportunities your team is actively pursuing.

    * **Won**: Opportunities your business has secured.

    * **Lost**: Opportunities that were unsuccessful.

  * Easily drag and drop opportunities between columns to update their status.

* **Opportunity Details**

  * Click on any opportunity to view and manage details:

    * View opportunity information and add notes.

    * Attach files relevant to the opportunity.

    * Share the opportunity with team members.

    * Unsave opportunities if they are no longer relevant.

* **Open vs. Expired Opportunities**

  * By default, the board displays only **open opportunities** (those with active bid deadlines).

  * To view **expired opportunities**, check the "Show Expired" box, and the board will update accordingly.

* **Collaboration for Teams**

  * All team members have access to the board, enabling seamless collaboration.

  * Team members can add notes, upload files, and adjust opportunity statuses in real-time.

* **Add New Opportunities**

  * Use the **Add New** button at the top-right corner to manually add opportunities that are off-platform.

  * Fields for adding a new opportunity:

    * **Name of Opportunity**

    * **Organization**

    * **Opportunity Description**

    * **Opportunity Contact Name**

    * **Contact Email**

    * **Contact Phone**

    * **Location: Place of Performance**

    * **Bid # or Reference ID**

    * **URL to Opportunity Source**

    * **Notes**: Add any additional details or context.

# How to Use Saved Opportunities

* **Save an Opportunity**

  * Opportunities from Haven Match or Find Opportunities can be saved with one click.

  * Once saved, they’ll appear on the **Backlog** column of the board.

* **Manage Workflow**

  * Move opportunities between columns to reflect their current status (e.g., from **Diligence** to **Bidding**).

  * Use the notes and file upload features to document progress and collaborate with your team.

* **Review Expired Opportunities**

  * Toggle the "Show Expired" option to review past opportunities, whether for reporting purposes or future planning.

* **Add External Opportunities**

  * Use the **Add New** button to incorporate opportunities from external sources, ensuring a complete pipeline view.

# Best Practices

* Regularly update the status of opportunities to keep your pipeline accurate and actionable.

* Encourage team collaboration by tagging team members in notes and sharing files.

* Use the "Show Expired" filter periodically to learn from lost opportunities or revisit expired ones for future cycles.

* Manually add off-platform opportunities to create a holistic view of all potential contracts.
