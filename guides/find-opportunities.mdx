# List View - Search & Find Opportunities

![](find-1.png)

* **Search Keyword**

  * *Use keywords that match the services, products, or capabilities your business offers.*

  * *Keywords can be broad (ie:* `Landscaping`*) or specific (ie:* `Lawncare`*).*

  * *Refine your search as needed by adding additional terms or using exact phrases.*

* **Enter Location**
  ![](find-3.png)

  * *Best practice is to begin by typing the name of the City or County of the area where you Business can perform the work.*

  * *Tip: Include “County” in your search for better results, such as* `Los Angeles County, CA, USA`.

  * *The Location Filter is an 100-Mile radius to the location entered.*

  * *Haven is expanding to allow searches across multiple locations.*

    * *For Example: Search opportunities in* `Los Angeles County, CA, USA` *and* `Orange County, CA, USA` *and* `San Diego County, CA, USA` *at the same time.*

  * *Some opportunities lack precise location data due to Buyer limitations. If you see* `Click Me!` *at the bottom of search results, pressing this will update the results to include opportunities where no location was provided by the Buyer.*

    * *In the example below, our 2 search inputs are:* `Search: landscaping` *and* `Location: Los Angeles County, CA, USA` *with a total of 66 results over 2 pages. Scrolling to the bottom of page 2 of the search results, we see there are* `27 other opportunities`. *If we click this to update the results, then the* `27` *results are simply:* `Search: landscaping` *and* `Location: Undefined`.

* **Haven Groups**

  * *Filter results by certification or special advantage using Haven Groups. Haven tags opportunities to represent advantages for Small Businesses, such as:*

    * *Agency Procurement Goals & Spend Objectives*

    * *Bid Preferences*

    * *Sole-Source*

    * *Set-Asides*

    * *…and more!*

  * *Available Haven Groups are:*

    * ***DBE***

    * ***Disability***

    * ***HUBZone***

    * ***Indigenous***

    * ***LGBTQ+***

    * ***Minority***

    * ***Non-Profit***

    * ***Small Business***

    * ***Socially Responsible***

    * ***Veteran***

    * ***Women***

* **+ Save Search**

  * *Save a search query by pressing* `+ Save Search` *and create a short, but memorable name to remember. These will be available for you on your Dashboard for you going forward.*

  * *Best used for queries combining* `Keyword` *+ other filters (ie: Location, Haven Groups, Organization, Industry Codes, Continuous, Contracts, Funding).*

  * *Easily revisit saved searches for future opportunities.*

* **Filters**:

  * `Type`

    * `Government` *- Opportunities for your Business to act as a Prime Contractor.*

      * *These are opportunities for you to be a Prime Contractor.*

    * `Relationship`- *Opportunities for your Business to act as a Sub-Contractor, typically with Private-Sector Buyers to partner with on Public-Sector contracts.*

  * `Status`

    * `Open` *- Currently accepting bids.*

    * `Closed` *- No longer accepting bids.*

    * `All` *- Includes both open and closed opportunities.*

  * `Continuous` (✅,❌)

    * *Check* ✅ *this box to update the results to include opportunities without a defined end date.*

      * *This means the Buyer is always accepting new proposals. It is extremely important to explore these opportunities further.*

  * `Industry Code`

    * *Filter results by specific industry codes like NAICS, PSC, NIGP Commodity Code, UNSPSC, Contractor Licenses, and more.*

  * `Organization`
    ![](find-2.png)

    * *Filter results by the Buying Organization/Entity/Party. For example:*

      * `California Department of Motor Vehicles`

    - `Organization`*s are classified by the Parent Entity. In Public Sector procurement, the structure is normally 1 “Parent” entity with multiple “Child” departments. In other words, the City of Inglewood CA oversees its Police Department, Housing Protection Department, City Clerk’s Office, Finance Department, etc.*

      * *Haven does not like this structure - we feel this creates unnecessary complications. However, we are open to feedback & acknowledge this is important to many.*

      * *Unfortunately, this is how many purchasing entities display their information. Haven believes over time, these will be further consolidated - and if not, Haven will do its best to simplify for our users.*

      * We can currently look at an example for The City of Los Angeles. Within the LA “Parent”, there are multiple “Child” Departments such as:

        * `Department of Water & Power (LADWP)`, `Department of General Services`, `Department on Disability`, `Housing Authority`, `Department of Recreation and Parks`*, etc.*

      * *Haven purposely names organizations differently. Instead of* `The City of Los Angeles`*, Haven prefers* `Los Angeles City`. *Likewise, we prefer* `Los Angeles County` *vs* `County of Los Angeles`*. This naming convention exists at all Buying levels.*

      * *Furthermore, Haven is working to aggregate this “Parent”/”Child” relationship amongst the* `Organization`*s. Haven will release a future update to make this simpler for our Clients.*

* **Contracts**

  * *Select the* `Contracts` *tab to view contract opportunities for your Business.*

  * *View contract-based opportunities, including RFQs, RFPs, Solicitations, Sources Sought, Presolicitations, etc.*

* **Funding**

  * *Select the* `Funding` *tab to view Grants, Financing, Capital opportunities for your Business.*

  * *These opportunities focus on financial support rather than procurement-based contracts.*
