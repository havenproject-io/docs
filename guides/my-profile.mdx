Add as many codes as possible, even beyond those on Agency registrations or one’s you’ve never used.*

  * *Start by adding codes from your capability statement. Use Haven’s search feature to filter by keyword (e.g., “Landscaping”) and select the relevant codes.

  * *Keywords help Haven match you with relevant contracts and can be edited here in your profile settings or on the **Find Opportunities** page. Think of all the terms a government buyer might use to describe your services or products, even if they aren’t directly related. Adding a wide range of keywords increases your chances of capturing opportunities that align with your capabilities.*
